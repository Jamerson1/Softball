  <h2>Introduction</h2>
Softball is a variant of baseball played with a larger ball (11 to 12 in. circumference) on a smaller field. It was invented in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, United States as an indoor game. The game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball. There is less time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the ball; yet, the fielder has less time to field the ball while the opponent is running down to first base. The name softball was given to the game in 1926, because the ball used to be soft.
